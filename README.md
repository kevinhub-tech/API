# API
> Application Programming Interface Project
### What was the project about?
The project was provided by BTEC assessment and it was remarked as an individual project. A scanerio was given to the students to create a application called "Know-Your-Neighbourhood" where the users can explore through the application to view the near-by stores around their neighbourhood. The requirements for the project was to 

1. Insist on using existing API's onto the application
2. Include a button that is integrated with API's for login
3. Assistance on users to log in with such ease.

And the project's main goal was to enhance the student's knowledge upon API and learn how to integrate with your application.
### What is API?

Speaking of API, Let's get a little bit into about what is API. API stands for Application programming interface and its description says it all that API helps every possible application to communicate and work with each other. It works in a unit to help the application to reach a certain goal of functionality. It is composed of protocols that will be structured to implement an integrated application software. And if further examination was executed, there are loads of examples for API. The closest for it would be 
 
- Google Login API
- Facebook Login API

And it was required to apply on one of the existing API to make the user log into the application easily. Therefore, it was implemented into the application.

### What I have done

The application was simply developed  with Java as I am currently learning about Java. Framework provided by java was applied duing the process of implementation which are 
- Spring Boot
- React JS
- REST API

And on the part what I have done on the project was 
- Learnt about different types of API 
- Developed Wireframes of API integrated web pages
- Applied prominent API onto the application with those wireframes
- Integrated with Facebook Login API to fetch user's information to fasten up the process of login

#### Wireframes

This was carried out before implementing the actual application with API and this is the product that will be put into work.

#### Results
After learning enough about spring boot and React Js, the wireframe was revaluated into an application.
